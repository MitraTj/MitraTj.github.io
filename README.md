About Me


I obtained my Ph.D. at Nanyang Technological University in 2022, advised by Prof. Joo Hwee Lim and Prof. Hanwang Zhang. Prior to the Ph.D., I received MSc degree in Electrical Engineering from Sharif University of Technology(SUT) in 2014, advised by Prof. Mehran Jahed.

My research mainly focuses on the fields of deep learning and computer vision, with particular focuses visual representation learning, and unbiased Visual annotations.
